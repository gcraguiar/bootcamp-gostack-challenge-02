## :rocket: About the Project

The goal of this challenge is to develop the first part of a gym management system, Gympoint.
In the first step of this project was developed the API, with it can include, search and update information such as name, email,
age, weight and height of students enrolled in the academy. In addition to performing session control and validating user access in the application.

The application framework follows the MVC (Model, View, and Controller) and JWT (JSON Web Token) standards for creating JSON-based access tokens.
The data contained therein can be validated at any time because the token is digitally signed and consists of three sections: Header, Payload and Signature.
This structure allows the implementation of an authentication system via HTTP, and can be sent in different request methods, such as:
POST, GET, PUT, DELETE thus making access to application data more secure.

The use of JWT in conjunction with Schema Validation (YUP) is critical to more consistently structure access to information in the database, so
the use of these features is essential for the proper functioning of the application.
